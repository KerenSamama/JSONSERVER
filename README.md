# JSONSERVER
#The purpose of the project is to develop a React application that interacts with a REST API to display and manage data from a server, using technologies such as React Router, React Hooks, and JavaScript Fetch. The application will include login, registration, and a user home page with features to display and manipulate lists of tasks (todos), posts, and photo albums, supporting actions like search, add, delete, and update data. The project also involves setting up a local JSON server to simulate server data, aiming to enhance skills in API integration and state management in React.
